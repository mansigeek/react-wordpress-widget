# Data Folder

This folder contains all the showcase data for the starter kit pages.

## Structure

- `home/` - Data for the home page (stats, features)
- `packages/` - Package information with npm links
- `features/` - Feature descriptions and capabilities

## For Your Team

When starting a new project, you can **delete this entire `data/` folder** along with the showcase pages (`app/page.tsx`, `app/packages/page.tsx`, `app/features/page.tsx`) to start with a clean slate.

The starter kit structure, components, and configuration will remain intact.
